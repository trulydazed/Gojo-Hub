# Gojo Hub's Official Github Repository.
Welcome to Gojo Hub – A script made for handling toxic players and exploiters in battleground-type games.

# If Not... You’re Not Supposed to Be Here.
If you're genuinely here for educational reasons or you're just curious — cool, respect. But this GitHub is mainly just a host.

If you're here to skid (steal/modify the code), Good luck.
This script is protected, not open-source, and not yours to mess with.

Stay clean, target toxic people only, and have fun.
This hub is built with care to keep the chaos in check — not to ruin the game for good players.
